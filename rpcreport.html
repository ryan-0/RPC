<div class="qa">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">Did you implement an rpcgenerate program and does it handle all legal IDL files? If not, which test cases should we try in your submission  directory?</li>
<li class="a">

</li>

<li class="q">What programming language did you use for your rpcgenerate program?</li>
<li class="a">
Put an X in the space next to your choice:
<ul>
  <li>_____ C++ (using the provided type framework)</li>
  <li>  X   Python (using the provided <code>idl_to_json</code>)</li>
  <li>_____ Ruby (using the provided <code>idl_to_json</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class="q">Briefly explain the protocol you use over TCP to request function calls and return the results.</li>
<li class="a">
<p>
Over TCP, the client sends the function name followed by
a space, followed by the function parameters. The function name is parsed similarly to
the provided dispatchFunction definition, except that we are expecting a space instead of
a NULL sentinel. All parameters are wrapped in some sort of open and close characters. Ints
and floats use parenthesis: (); structs are surrounded by curly braces: {}; arrays are
surrounded by square brackets: []. Strings are more difficult becuause if we use something
like parenthesis then we run the risk of encountering a string that containts the same class
of parenthesis, which would mess up the parsing. We decided to use ASCII character 0x1F which
is the "unit separator" character. We do not expect this to appear in normal use-cases so it
is probably safe to use. For a more serious implementation we would probably resort to
escape our separators. JSON for example uses quotes to enclose strings and then escapes
challenging characters.
</p>
<p>
Parameters are passed as strings. We convert ints and float to strings usinng the to_string function
and then decode them with stoi and stof, respectively. All "top-level" parameters are enclosed
in their own set of separator. So even a complex parameter like a struct with arrays would all
be enclosed in "{" and "}". For arrays and structs, we recursively parse "parameters" within
the parsed enclosing array or struct. All complex types (i.e. anything that is not a built-in)
gets a dynamically created serializer and deserializer.
</p>
<p>
We structured our code with the Jinja templating language, which is availalbe as as a package
on the Halligan computers. Most of our rpcgenerate just passes an environment into the template
renderer and allows the template to determine what to do. The template for the stub will

<li class="q">Did you get help from anyone other than your teammate? If "yes", then briefly explain who helped you and how.</li>
<li class="a">
No, we did not get any outside help.
</li>


<li class="q">(optional) Do you have any other comments on this assignment (e.g. was it worthwhile, what did you learn from it, do you have suggestions for improvment if the course is offered again)?</li>
<li class="a">
<p>
It was a bit unclear what format was epxected on the wire. We chatted with some other groups who
ended up just writing bytes onto the socket one by one (i.e. to transmit an int simply cast
to a char array and write). We had the impression that a more portable JSON-like format was
expected so we took that route. 
</p>
<p>
Overall, the assignment was interesting and useful. We got hung up on compiling idl files
with strings. The Piazza post on the topic was helpful but it would be nice to include
a snippet on how to test strings.
